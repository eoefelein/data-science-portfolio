### Machine Learning & AI

[Optimization of Renewable Energy to Supply Chains](https://blog.paperspace.com/optimizing-the-integration-of-renewable-energy-to-our-supply-chains/)

This project applied Linear Programming in Python to optimize the integration of renewable energy sources into a multinational company’s supply chain, maximizing energy output while minimizing costs under budget constraints.
More broadly, this approach illustrates how optimization frameworks can guide decision-making by efficiently allocating resources to achieve the best outcomes across costs, performance, and strategic goals.

[A Bayesian Approach to Supplier Optimization](https://medium.com/@oefeleinerin/a-bayesian-approach-to-supplier-optimization-9efb2e2c9a58)

This project applied Bayesian modeling in Python to optimize a supplier mix for PC manufacturing, accounting for variability in supplier yields and quality control to reduce lost product costs and estimate potential production capacity.

More broadly, this approach allows us to see the full range of possible outcomes, not just the average. It incorporates uncertainty and context, showing how results could vary and helping us make more informed, robust decisions. That way, we can better allocate resources, plan for risks, and optimize outcomes even when the data is limited or variable.

[Love Island's Love Algorithm](https://blog.paperspace.com/winning-hearts-love-islands-love-algorithm/)

Behavior in networked systems is often difficult to predict due to complex, higher order relationships between entities. Within this project, I apply Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to model these relationships, an approach that applies to social networks, boosting content recommendation systems, ad targeting, fraud detection and trend detection with website user behavior by understanding not just individual actions but the network of relationships between them.

[Personalizing the Customer Experience with Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.com/@oefeleinerin/smarter-engagement-lower-churn-the-role-of-reinforcement-learning-in-personalizing-the-customer-82580b39c2f2)

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** solution using **SARSA(λ)** and tile coding to dynamically optimize user interactions on an online tax filing platform, reducing user churn and improving retention, driving revenue by learning which actions work best in different user states.

This approach applies to any situation where outcomes depend on sequential decisions and user behavior is dynamic, such as e-commerce, gaming, online education, or subscription services. By modeling users as agents interacting with an environment and continuously learning from feedback, RL can personalize experiences, automate complex decision-making, and adapt strategies in real-time in ways traditional  ML models cannot.

[Bayes for Business](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

This project applies Bayesian probabilistic modeling to optimize marketing spend across channels, combining domain knowledge with observed data to estimate the true impact of marketing channels and maximize customer acquisition.

Bayesian probabilistic models are growing in popularity, recognized for providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of marketing effectiveness. Applicable in any business context, this approach offers key advantages including:
 - The model fosters business buy-in by integrating domain expertise, actively involving stakeholders in the modeling process.
 - Quantifies channel impact by attributing customer acquisition to each marketing channel directly. 
 - Shows how to allocate funds to maximize customer acquisition.

### Data Engineering & Pipelines

[Azure Real Estate Rental Data Pipeline](https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-pipeline)

Built an Azure data pipeline to collect U.S. rental listings automatically, measuring rental market turnover. Analyzed features such as number of bedrooms, location, and amenities to identify what drives rental pricing & demand, providing actionable insights for investors and property managers.

[Amazon Resale Ticket Pricing Pipeline](https://github.com/yourusername/ticket-pricing-pipeline)

Developed a data pipeline in AWS to automatically collect pricing data on resale tickets from multiple platforms. Processed and stored structured data to analyze trends, identify pricing patterns, and assess market dynamics. Insights from this pipeline inform pricing strategies and highlight factors that drive ticket value in secondary markets.

[Tiny House Nation the SQL](/sample_page)

What drives consumer behavior? Using tiny home listing data, this project explores whether lifestyle preference or economic factors drive consumers to adopt a tiny home lifestyle. In this project, I build a full data pipeline using Scrapy and Selenium to scrape U.S. tiny house listings. To understand spatial trends, I applied the Local Moran’s I statistic to identify pricing clusters. Users can visualize where pricing drives tiny home living using a Dash application, productionized using Docker and deployed on GCP for scalable, interactive exploration.

[Building a Career Pipeline](https://github.com/eoefelein/Beautiful_Soup_Mongo_xlsxwriter)

Built a data pipeline to extract job posting data in the tech sector from Austin’s Craigslist, storing it in an unstructured MongoDB database and exporting to Microsoft Excel at a scheduled time every day.

### Workshops & Education

[WiDSAI Workshops](https://github.com/eoefelein/WiDSAI_Python_Workshop)
Created and facilitated a hands-on Python workshop (WiDSAI) in Google Colab, allowing learners to explore real datasets, practice data analysis, and build coding skills independently.

### Academic Research

[SHAPing the Future of Electrocatalysts](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00544)
Machine learning models are often difficult to interpret, making it challenging for researchers to understand which electrocatalyst material properties drive performance. This project demonstrates how SHAP empowers researchers with identifying promising candidates, near, but not identical to, known electrocatalysts, demonstrating how interpretable model guide decision-making and scientific discovery.

[Winning with Probability](https://medium.com/data-science/magic-the-gathering-arena-winning-with-probability-b71f363e0ce2)
This project models outcomes in environments where user decisions interact with probabilistic events and rewards. By applying probabilistic analysis to sequential decision-making scenarios, I demonstrated how strategy and chance combine to shape outcomes, enabling insights into behavior, engagement, and potential optimization of rules or incentives.
More broadly, these concepts extend to the education and adaptive learning space, where student success probabilities can be modeled in platforms where outcomes depend not only on students’ choices (e.g., problem-solving paths) but also on inherent uncertainties such as mastery level or question difficulty.

[LASSO](https://medium.com/data-science/lasso-increases-the-interpretability-and-accuracy-of-linear-models-c1b340561c10)
This article shows how LASSO uses an L1 penalty to perform feature selection and reduce collinearity, building sparser, more interpretable models. Visualizations of constraint regions and contours illustrate why some coefficients shrink to zero, giving an intuitive, math-backed understanding of LASSO.
